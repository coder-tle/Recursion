Function calling itself is called recursive function.
Tail recursive functions are those functions in which function call is the last 
statement to be executed. 

Depending upon on how function calls itself there exists direct and indirect 
recursion.

Situation of indirect recursion arise, when function call itself via 
intermediate function.
